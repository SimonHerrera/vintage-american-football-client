      <h4>Organize your own Vintage American Football game...</h4>
      <p>One of our goals is to spread the game of Vintage American Football. The only way to grow the game is to make sure that everyone is following the same rules and using the same equipment.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this page is to share the rules and equipment suppliers that we use as well as educate on football in the early 1900's through the 1920's.</p>

      <h4>Future V.A.F. Teams</h4>
      <p>While researching vintage football we have found that back from the early 1900's - 1920's football spread across the country from city to city. Initially a neighborhood team would pop up and challenge another neighborhood team to a game. Often these teams took neighborhood names, ciy names or even business names depending on the manager. This meant that some cities had several teams each year, some at different weight classes and some at different professional levels.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to revive those old neighborhood, city and business teams and help find them a local opponents for a game. The beauty and fun of this is that we will be growing the game exactly as they did over 100 years ago.</p>
      <p>In addition to reviving actual franchises, we would like those interested to be able to create their own vintage teams, teams that represent modern neighborhoods or locations near and dear to the current franchise owner. All we ask is for a bit of history on the local teams that used to exist in that area and then your desired name, primary and secondary colors for your jerseys.</p>
      <p>Once your team is created we will list it below and others in your area can find you and challenge you to a game! Even if this never happens, you will still be granted your very own Vintage American Football team that will be certified as yours by us. We will send you a franchise title electronically and then it will be official. Who doesn't want to own their very own football team?</p>
