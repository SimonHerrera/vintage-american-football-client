      <h4>Organize your own Vintage American Football game...</h4>
      <p>One of our goals is to spread the game of Vintage American Football. The only way to grow the game is to make sure that everyone is following the same rules and using the same equipment.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this page is to share the rules and equipment suppliers that we use as well as educate on football in the early 1900's through the 1920's.</p>
