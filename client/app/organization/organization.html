      <h4>Organize your own Vintage American Football game...</h4>
      <p>One of our goals is to spread the game of Vintage American Football. The game will only grow if we make sure that everyone is playing by the same rules and using the same equipment.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this page is to share the rules and equipment suppliers that we use as well as educate on football in the early 1900's through the 1920's.</p>

      <h4>Own your own Vintage football team...</h4>
      <p>While researching vintage football we have found that football started much like baseball. It was played in small city parks by neighborhood teams. One neighborhood would challenge another and the better team would live on. Often these teams took street names, neighborhood names, city names or even business names depending on the manager. Some cities had several teams each year, some of these teams were different weight classes and some were at different levels.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to revive those old neighborhood, city and business teams and help them find games with their old rivals. Using this approach we will be growing the game exactly as they did over 100 years ago.</p>
