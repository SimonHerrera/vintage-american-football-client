      <h4>About...</h4>
      <p>Vintage American Football was organized in February of 2015. The game is based on 1920's football rules and equipment. The goal was to revive the 100 year old football rivalry between the cities of Moline and Rock Island in the Quad Cities.</p>
      <p>The Simon Herrera and Chris Zimmerman joined forces with former Augustana coach Jim Barnes and they pitched the idea of a game in Douglas Park to Rock Island Parks and Rec. With their blessing the plans moved forward for a game in late August.</p>
      <p>After months of planning the game was on. 500+ fans of 1920's football s filled Douglas Park and watched the two teams play a game that looked similar to how a game would have looked in 1920.</p>
      <p>In 2016 Douglas Park again hosted the two teams. The event was a success but temperatures in the 90's kept the attendance down and took a toll on the players. After the game it was decided that in the future the game would be held in late September or early October.</p>
      <p>The game in 2017 will be played at the Hauberg Estate in Rock Island. Douglas Park has received some attention and as a result $125,000 has been donated to help improve the park. The area where the game is usually played on will be under repair this fall and not finished in time to host the game.</p>
      <p>The pregame will start at 3:00PM and the kickoff will be at 3:30PM. This year the game will be promoted by Rock Island Parks and Rec so we are hoping for our biggest crowd yet!</p>
