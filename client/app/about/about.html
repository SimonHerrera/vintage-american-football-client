      <h4>About...</h4>
      <p>Vintage American Football was organized in February of 2015. The game is based on 1920's football rules and equipment. The goal was to revive the 100 year old football rivalry between the cities of Moline and Rock Island in the Quad Cities.</p>
      <p>The Simon Herrera and Chris Zimmerman joined forces with former Augustana coach Jim Barnes and they pitched the idea of a game in Douglas Park to Rock Island Parks and Rec. With their blessing the plans moved forward for a game in late August.</p>
      <p>After months of planning the game was on. 500+ fans of 1920's football s filled Douglas Park and watched the two teams play a game that looked similar to how a game would have looked in 1920.</p>
      <p>In 2016 Douglas Park again hosted the two teams. The event was a success but temperatures in the 90's kept the attendance down and took a toll on the players. After the game it was decided that in the future the game would be held in late September or early October.</p>
      <p>The game in 2017 will be played at the Hauberg Estate in Rock Island. Douglas Park has received some attention and as a result $125,000 has been donated to help improve the park. The area where the game is usually played on will be under repair this fall and not finished in time to host the game.</p>
      <p>The pregame will start at 3:00PM and the kickoff will be at 3:30PM. Starting the game at 3:30 will allow for the lights come on and be a part of the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>This year the game will be promoted by Rock Island Parks and Rec. Friends of Douglas Park and Friends of the Hauberg Estate will coordinate the effort. We are hoping for our biggest crowd yet!</p>
      <p>Also, Happy Joes Pizza and Bent River Brewing should be back. There will also be a grill set up by Rock Island Parks and Rec.</p>

      <h4>Play in our Rock Island Game...</h4>
      <p>We are working hard to reduce the cost for players. In the past couple of years the cost for the player was significant. This year we are working to let Rock Island Parks and Rec. take over the event. If we can get some assistance from them we should be able to reduce our costs and potentially allow the players (who are really volunteers) play for a minimal fee.</p>
