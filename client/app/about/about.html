      <h4>About...</h4>
      <p>Vintage American Football was organized in February of 2015. The idea of playing a game using 1920's rules was brought up to Simon Herrera by Chris Zimmerman. Simon's Rock Island Independent's website gave Chris the idea of challenging Simon and his team to a game. The goal was to revive the 100 year old football rivalry between the cities of Moline and Rock Island in the Quad Cities.</p>
      <p>The two joined forces with former Augustana football coach Jim Barnes and they pitched the idea of a game in Douglas Park to Rock Island Parks and Rec. With the blessing of the Parks and Rec. the two moved forward with plans for a game in late August</p>
