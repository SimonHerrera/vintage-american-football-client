      <h4>What is Vintage American Football...</h4>
      <p>Vintage football is for historians and enthusiasts – those of us who are drawn to the simplicity of the game in its early years.</p>
      <p>If you love the aesthetics of football in the 1920s – including the unique jersey designs, leather helmets, and fat football – you’ll love participating in vintage football, which is part athletic pursuit, and part historical exploration.</p>

      <h4>Basic Rules We Use...</h4>
      <p>To play 1920's football you need to start by using the same equipment. We use a replica Melon football that is much wider and harder to throw than a modern day football.</p>
      <p>We use a field that is has no hash marks and has the goal posts set on the goalline.</p>
      <p>The offensive formations and the ball promotes "Straight Football", running the ball as they did in the 1920's.  </p>
      <p>Special rules promote team attempting drop kicks for field goals and extra point</p>
      <p>1920's rule example - If ball is thrown into the end zone it is considered a touchback and goes to the defense.
