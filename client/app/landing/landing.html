      <h4>What is Vintage American Football...</h4>
      <p>Vintage football is for historians and enthusiasts – those of us who are drawn to the simplicity of the game in its early years.</p>
      <p>If you love the aesthetics of football in the 1920s – including the unique jersey designs, leather helmets, and fat melon football – you’ll love participating in vintage football, which is part athletic pursuit, and part historical exploration.</p>

      <h4>Basic Rules...</h4>
      <p>To play 1920's football you need to start by using the same equipment. We use a Melon football that is much wider and harder to throw than a modern day foot ball. To complete the look, each team has their own custom 1920's jersey.</p>
      <p>We use an 80 yard field that has no hash marks and has the goal posts set on the goalline.</p>
      <p>When the ball goes out of bounds it will be placed 10 yeards from the sideline to start the next play.
      <p>Each team must huddle after each play and signals must be call out loud prior to the snap.<p>
      <p>The offensive formations and the ball promotes "Straight Football" or running the ball as they did in the 1920's.  </p>
      <p>Drop Kicks when used on a field goal or extra points are worth 1 extra point, (4 or 2 points)</p>
      <p>A ball thrown into the end zone is considered a touchback and goes to the defense at the 10 yard line.</p>
      <p>Team Captains can agree to shorted the time for each quarter before or during the game.</p>

      <p>The game will be played later in the year and later in the day. 100 years ago the first game of the season was often held in late September or early October. Game start time was usually around 3 P.M. This should make the look and feel even more accurate.

      <p>Pregame Starts at 12:30 - Kickoff is at 1:00 C.S.T.</p>
