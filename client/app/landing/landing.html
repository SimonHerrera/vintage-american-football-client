      <h4>The goals of our game...</h4>
      <p>To entertain and educate the community by playing a game that (from their perspective) has the look and feel of a 1920s game.</p>
      <p>To create a game that for the players is safe and uses similar equipment, rules and strategies used in a 1920's football game.</p>

      <h4>Our first game...</h4>
      <p>On August 23rd, 2015 the first Vintage American Football game was played at Douglas Park in Rock Island Illinois.</p>
      <p>The game itself was a mix between 1920's American Football and modern day Flag Football.</p>
      <p>The two teams used a replica Melon football, replica uniforms & equipment and rules similar to those used in 1920.</p>
      <p>The same site also hosted the very first game involving a team from the newly formed NFL (95 years earlier) in 1920.</p>
