      <h4>What is Vintage American Football...</h4>
      <p>Vintage football is for historians and enthusiasts – those of us who are drawn to the simplicity of the game in its early years.</p>
      <p>If you love the aesthetics of football in the 1920s – including the unique jersey designs, leather helmets, and fat football – you’ll love participating in vintage football, which is part athletic pursuit, and part historical exploration.</p>

      <h4>Basic Rules We...</h4>
      <p>To play 1920's football you need to start by using the same equipment. We use a replica Melon football that is much wider and harder to throw than a modern day football.</p>
      <p>We use a field that is has no hash marks and has the goal posts set on the goalline.</p>
      <p>The offensive formations and the ball promotes "Straight Football", running the ball as they did in the 1920's.  </p>
      <p>Special rules promote team attempting drop kicks for field goals and extra point</p>
      <p>1920's rule example - If ball is thrown into the end zone it is considered a touchback and goes to the defense.

      <b>Details...</b>
      <p>The game will be played later in the year and later in the day. 100 years ago the first game of the season was often held in late September or early October. Game start time was usually around 3 P.M. This should make the look and feel even more accurate. As dusk approaches we will turn on the lights at Douglas to finish the game if needed.
