    <p>On August 23rd, 2015 the first Vintage American Football game was played at Douglas Park in Rock Island Illinois. On that day Vintage American Football was born. The same site also hosted the first game involving a team from the newly formed NFL (95 years earlier).</p>

    <p>The game itself was a mix between 1920's American Football and modern day Flag Football.</p>

    <p>The two teams used a replica Melon football, replica uniforms & equipment and rules similar to those used in 1920.</p>
