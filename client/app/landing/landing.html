      <h4>What is Vintage American Football...</h4>
      <p>Vintage football is for historians and enthusiasts – those of us who are drawn to the simplicity of the game in its early years.</p>
      <p>If you love the aesthetics of football in the 1920s – including the unique jersey designs, leather helmets, and fat melon football – you’ll love participating in vintage football, which is part athletic pursuit, and part historical exploration.</p>

      <h4>Our Vision...</h4>
      <p>To allow everyone the opportunity to experience a 1920's football game in their neighborhood or city.</p>
      <h4>Our Mission...</h4>
      <p>To entertain and educate communities on football history by playing games that have the look and feel of a 1920s football game.</p>
      <p>To create a game for the players that is safe and uses similar equipment, rules and strategies of 1920's football.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h4>Basic Rules...</h4>
      <p>To play 1920's football you'll need to start by using the same equipment. We use a Melon football which is much wider and harder to throw than a modern day foot ball. The ball is 22-23 inches around. To complete the look, each team has their own custom 1920's jersey.</p>
      <p>We use an 80 yard field that has no hash marks and has the goal posts set on the goalline.</p>
      <p>When the ball goes out of bounds it will be placed 10 yards from the sideline to start the next play.
      <p>Each team must huddle after each play and signals must be call out loud prior to the snap.<p>
      <p>The offensive formations and the ball promotes "Straight Football" or running the ball as they did in the 1920's.</p>
      <p>Drop Kicks when used on a field goal or extra points are worth 1 extra point, (4 or 2 points). We have set the drop kick points to one higher than place kicks to promote them actually being tried.</p>
      <p>An incomplete pass thrown into or out of the back of the end zone is considered a touchback and goes to the defense at the 10 yard line.</p>
      <p>A running clock is used to make sure that the half does not go over 45-50 minutes. Team Captains can agree to shorted the time for each quarter before or during the game.</p>
      <p>Another modern rule mixed in for safety is that once a snaped or fumbled ball bounces twice or rolls the play will be called dead. On kicks after this occurs the ball will be downed once touched</p>
      <p>For safety purposes, in our game the quarterback will call the color "Red" to let the defense know they are kicking he ball, a full rush by the defense is not allowed on kick plays. In the case of a bad snap the kicker will be able to gather the ball an get off a kick</p>
      <p>Extra points will be tried from the 20 yard line. The team who score will use a holder and kicker to attempt a 1 point extra point. The team can opt for 2 points if they want to try for 2 points. This promotes the use of drop kicks and was not an option back in 1920 but our goal is to show off some of the types of plays that made the game different, the drop kick is one of those plays.</p>

      <p>Douglas Park also hosted the very first game involving the Independents from the newly formed NFL (95 years earlier) on September 26th 1920. The Independents beat the St. Paul Ideals by a score of 48-0.</p>

      <h4>Upcoming Vintage Games...</h4>

      <p>Pregame Starts at 3 - Kickoff is at 3:30 C.S.T.</p>
      <p>Details...</p>
      <p>This will be our third annual game in Rock Island game.</p>
      <p>Douglas Park has been receiving some attention. An organization called Friends of Douglas park has raised $135,000+ for repairs. This fall the field at Douglas will be under repair. We will play the game this season at the Hauberg Estate on 23rd street. The Friends of Hauberg are excited to co-host with the Rock Island Parks and Rec. Playing in front of the house in the neighborhood up on the hill should be quite a sight.
      </p>
      <p>Free Admission, 1920's music, 1920's Automobiles, pizza, beer and football!</p>
      <p>Also, in 2017 we will have an actual 1920 Moline Universal Tractor on hand!</p>
      <p>Just confirmed, the Bill McCabe 1920's Jazz band will be playing at 2:15PM! Come early to enjoy the music.</p>
      <p>The game this year will be played later in the year and later in the day. 100 years ago the first game of the season was often held in late September or early October. Game start time was usually around 3 P.M. This should make the look and feel even more accurate.
      </p>
      <p>Pat Angerer - Local QC Resident and Hawkeye/NFL great will be attending the game! We plan on asking Pat to come out and help us with the coin toss!<p>
