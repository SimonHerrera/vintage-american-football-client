      <h4>The goals of the game...</h4>
      <p>To entertain and educate communities by playing games that have the look and feel of a 1920s football game.</p>
      <p>To create a game that for the players is safe and uses similar equipment, rules and strategies from 1920's football.</p>

      <h4>Our first game...</h4>
      <p>On August 23rd, 2015 the first Vintage American Football game was played at Douglas Park in Rock Island Illinois.</p>
      <p>The game itself was a mix between 1920's American Football and modern day Flag Football.</p>
      <p>The two teams used a replica Melon football, replica uniforms & equipment and rules similar to those used in 1920.</p>
      <p>The same site also hosted the very first game involving a team from the newly formed NFL (95 years earlier) in 1920.</p>
