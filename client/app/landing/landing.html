      <h4>What is Vintage American Football...</h4>
      <p>Vintage football is for historians and enthusiasts – those of us who are drawn to the simplicity of the game in its early years.</p>
      <p>If you love the aesthetics of football in the 1920s – including the unique jersey designs, leather helmets, and fat melon football – you’ll love participating in vintage football, which is part athletic pursuit, and part historical exploration.</p>

      <h4>Our Vision...</h4>
      <p>To allow everyone the opportunity to experience a 1920's football game in their neighborhood or city.</p>
      <h4>Our Mission...</h4>
      <p>To entertain and educate communities on football history by playing games that have the look and feel of a 1920s football game.</p>
      <p>To create a game for the players that is safe and uses similar equipment, rules and strategies of 1920's football.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h4>Basic Rules...</h4>
      <p>To play 1920's football you'll need to start by using the same equipment. We use a Melon football which is much wider and harder to throw than a modern day foot ball. The ball is 22-23 inches around. To complete the look, each team has their own custom 1920's jersey.</p>
      <p>We use an 80 yard field that has no hash marks and has the goal posts set on the goalline.</p>
      <p>When the ball goes out of bounds it will be placed 10 yards from the sideline to start the next play.
      <p>Each team must huddle after each play and signals must be call out loud prior to the snap.<p>
      <p>The offensive formations and the ball promotes "Straight Football" or running the ball as they did in the 1920's.</p>
      <p>Drop Kicks when used on an extra points are worth 1 extra point, (2 points). This promotes teams trying drop kicks.</p>
      <p>An incomplete pass thrown into or out of the back of the end zone is considered a touchback and goes to the defense at the 10 yard line.</p>
      <p>A running clock is used to make sure that the half does not go over 45-50 minutes. Team Captains can agree to shorted the time for each quarter before or during the game.</p>
      <p>Another modern rule mixed in for safety is that once a snaped or fumbled ball bounces twice or rolls the play will be called dead. On kicks after this occurs the ball will be downed once touched</p>
      <p>For safety purposes, in our game the quarterback will call the color "Red" to let the defense know they are kicking he ball, a full rush by the defense is not allowed on kick plays. In the case of a bad snap the kicker will be able to gather the ball an get off a kick</p>
      <p>Extra points will be tried from the 20 yard line. The team who score will use a holder and kicker to attempt a 1 point extra point. The team can opt for a 2 point drop kick if they want to try for 2 points. This promotes the use of drop kicks and was not an option back in 1920 but our goal is to show off some of the types of plays that made the game different, the drop kick is one of those plays.</p>

      <h4>Game History...</h4>
      <b>Rock Island Independents vs Moline Universal Tractors</b>
      <p>The Independents won by a score of 24-0.</p>
      <p>On August 23rd, 2015 the first Vintage American Football game was played at Douglas Park in Rock Island Illinois. The teams represented were the Rock Island Independents and the Moline Universal Tractors. Douglas Park also hosted the very first game involving the Independents from the newly formed NFL (95 years earlier) on September 26th 1920. The Independents beat the St. Paul Ideals by a score of 48-0.</p>
      <p>The Game... Rock Island opened Vintage Football with a bit of modern play. In the first quarter QB "Caspers" threw 2 long touchdowns to Co-organizer "Nips" Herrera. Early in the 3rd quarter Rock Island sealed the game with another score.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2016 August 28th - 2:00 P.M. Douglas Park - Rock Island Illinois</h4>
      <b>Rock Island Independents vs Moline Universal Tractors</b>
      <p>The MUTs won by a score of 28-9.</p>
      <p>The Game... With temperatures in the low 90's the MUTs took advantage of their deeper bench and ran all over the Independents. Rock Island was without their Quarterback "Caspers" and could not mount much of a rushing attack. At the half Rock Island trailed by a score of 14-9 but they were physically exhausted by the half as Moline racked up 2 more touchdowns before the day was over.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2016 November 13th - 12 P.M. Alvin C York State Park</h4>
      <b>USMC vs Army</b>
      <p>A 1918 Reenactment Game was played between the U.S. Army and the United States Marine Corps.</p>
      <p>In the game the Marines jumped out to a 3-0 lead but the Army stormed back and took the game 13-10.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2017 - October 15th - 3:30 P.M. Hauberg Estate Field - Rock Island Illnois</h4>
      <b>Rock Island Independents vs Moline Universal Tractors</b>
      <p>The MUTs won by a score of 17-6.</p>
      <p>Douglas Park has been receiving some attention. An organization called Friends of Douglas park has raised $135,000+ for repairs. This fall the field at Douglas was under repair so we played the game this season at the Hauberg Estate on 23rd street. The Friends of Hauberg were excited to co-host with the Rock Island Parks and Rec. Playing in front of the house, it was quite a sight.
      </p>
      <p>The event featured Free Admission, 1920's music, 1920's Automobiles, grilled food, beer and football!</p>
      <p>We also had an actual 1920 Moline Universal Tractor on hand!</p>
      <p>The Bill McCabe 1920's Jazz band played 1920's jazz and the crowd arrived and filled the park.</p>
      <p>The Game... After a few defensive stops the MUTs finally got on the board with a touchdown on a crossing route over the middle from about 25 yards out. At the half Rock Island held the ball around midfield as the clock expired. Moline added another touchdown and field goal in the second half to jump out to a 17-0 lead. Rock Island ran the ball well in the second half with one drive stalling out with an incomplete pass into the endzone (touchback by rule in 1920). On the final play of the game Rock Island completed a pass into the endzone for a touchdown as time expired. The pass literally went through the goal posts and was caught to make the score 17-6. The extra point was missed and the two teams shook hands to conclude the event.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2017 November 12th - 12 P.M. Alvin C York State Park</h4>
      <b>USMC vs Army</b>
      <p>The Marines won the game easily. They were able to run around the ends and were well organized on offense. The Army had trouble moving the ball on the ground and had to resort to passing which proved to be a mistake as they threw several interceptions on the day.</p>
